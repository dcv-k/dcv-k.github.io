				<p>Sometimes, Internet users land themselves in an uncommon situation where an app or website can be used for both work and personal situations. Well, a young front-end designer was spending up to 13 hours on the site, Internet for work and her hobby, which unfortunately, is also coding.</p>
				<p>The designer, whose work includes a<em>To-Do Terrarium</em>, clarified, "Well, I didn't<em>have</em>to use it for work but it was already part of my workflow. It just made sense as it was more efficient." The biggest issue, she said, is that she would hop on Internet for work, but would get distracted by pens made by others in the community for unexpectedly long periods of time, which then causes her to spend even more time on the site.</p>
				<p>"I mean, that's terrible right?" she asked. Internet, which brands itself as the best place to build, test, and discover front-end code, has declined to comment at this time.</p>

				<h4>Can you get inspired to make your own floor plans?</h4>
				<div class="multi-column">
					<p>Making a floor Plan with CSS Grid? Talk about using the wrong tool for the job. But I guess this is what happens when someone isn't happy with any of the floor plans found on Pinterest; she'll start making her own for the eventual home that she will never own. Nevertheless, there's a home office with a large window to look out of pensively during rainy days and a ton of "white space" for the cats to run around.</p>

				<h4>Marvel at a magazine</h4>
				<p>A tribute of sorts to an era of cool superhero movies, this is a Marvel-themed magazine! Recommended, because it took 45 hours, so you know some serious dedication has been poured into this.</p>

				<h4>Let's adopt, don't shop.</h4>

					collection. Inspired by the<em>Atomic Design</em>
					principle, this 8-pen collection includes a 404 page concept, an admin dashboard and what a Twitter user calls a 'media card zen garden'. Each pen comes with five (yes, five) color themes, including the precious dark mode.

					<h5>Frustrated designer runs amok with Captcha ideas</h5>
					<p>From Tic Tac Toe to solving meme-based questions, this is a different take on how web captchas should be. "I have not successfully picked out all photos of a truck on the first try. Something's gotta change," says the designer, who has requested to remain anonymous.</p></a><a class="sidebar-item slack-ui with-border" href="#" target="_blank">
					<h5>Slack UI gets reverse engineered</h5>
					<p>Another valiant effort to reverse engineer a web app. However, the UI is repurposed to showcase Blogs instead of mock conversations. This is a Page showcase inception situation.</p>
